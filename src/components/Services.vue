                Backend development is my passion, and creating RESTful APIs as

                  with a strong foundation in both physics and computer science.
                  I have completed various courses and boot camps to expand my

                  degree due to personal reasons. However, this experience
                  helped me develop a strong analytical mindset and

                  Java, MySQL, database management, security, and the use of
                  microservices. I learned how to work with Docker and GitHub

                  learned about application design and development, including

                          Since I was very young, new technologies have always
                          fascinated me. Since the age of 8, I had access to a
                          computer or video game console that allowed me to
                          tinker and expand my knowledge while entertaining
                          myself. During my youth, I also developed a passion
                          for everything related to mathematics and physics,
                          which led me to study Physics in college. Throughout
                          my professional life, I have always felt that I could
                          do something more, direct myself towards another
                          sector related to what I am passionate about, so I
                          decided to train myself in the field of web
                          application development. I started with a backend
                          bootcamp that opened the doors to a great world of
                          possibilities, and then complemented it with a
                          frontend one that allows me to have a very broad
                          profile within the market. Even so, I continue to
                          expand my horizons as I follow my path in the world of
                          new technologies.

                  the website using VUE.JS or any other framework (in this
                  world, everything is possible if you set your mind to it).
